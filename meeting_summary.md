This is a transcript from a Udacity webinar about the **Master's in AI Capstone Project**. The session features Patrick (Marketing), Jared (VP of Consumer), and Dr. Brandy Robinson (Instructional Design Leader) discussing the structure, requirements, and unique features of the capstone.

Program Structure
-----------------

The Master's in AI program consists of three components: core modules (required courses), elective modules (catalog of nanodegrees), and the capstone project worth 30 ECTS credits. The capstone represents 30% of the entire degree and builds upon all core coursework.

Capstone Components
-------------------

The capstone includes **seven projects total**: six projects mapping to each core nanodegree, plus a final synthesis project equivalent to a traditional master's thesis. The first six projects take approximately 100 hours each to complete, while the synthesis project requires about 150 hours. Each project allows students to explore different AI fields with flexibility in choosing topics, datasets, and applications within defined parameters.

Thesis and Defense
------------------

Students complete a paper documenting their process, iterations, challenges, and ethical considerations alongside their project deliverables. The defense is a 30-minute live session with a mentor: 15 minutes for presenting the project and 15 minutes for Q&A where mentors explore the student's expertise and decision-making. Unlike traditional programs, there's no formal approval process---students work within clearly articulated guidelines and parameters.

Grading and Evaluation
----------------------

Each project is evaluated independently by human mentors (over 1,000 industry experts) who review against specific rubrics. Grading follows this structure: first submission pass = A, second submission pass = B, third = C. The final capstone grade averages performance across all seven projects. Students receive detailed feedback with each review.

Support System
--------------

While there isn't a traditional thesis advisor, students access mentors through bi-weekly office hours, community forums, and asynchronous feedback on project submissions. The same mentor grades and conducts the defense for the synthesis project, providing consistency in that final phase.

Unique Value Proposition
------------------------

The program emphasizes **skills-based learning** with tangible deliverables over purely theoretical work. Graduates leave with a comprehensive GitHub portfolio containing dozens of projects demonstrating real-world problem-solving abilities. The focus is on creating actual working solutions rather than just writing about potential solutions.

Practical Considerations
------------------------

Students can base projects on real-world work contexts but must ensure data confidentiality with their employers. All work must be completed individually per the honor code---no team submissions allowed. AI tools can assist with execution (like running tests or visualizations), but core ideas, execution logic, and writing must be the student's own work. Plagiarism is monitored through multiple tools and handled case-by-case.

Intellectual Property
---------------------

Student capstone projects remain the intellectual property of the students, though official documentation should be consulted for complete legal details. Projects are not made public by Udacity without student permission.
